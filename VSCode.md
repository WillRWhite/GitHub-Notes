### Using GitHub with VSCode

Senario 1 - Existing folder on local machine containing project but Git is not initilised:

* Go to Git icon and select "initilise Repository". This will create a .git configuration sub-folder

* stage/commit = First commit

* Then publish and you should get choices of where you can publish assuming you are connected to some repos

* Verify that items have indeed been published
